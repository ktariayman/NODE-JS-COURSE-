We're going to be exploring space planets beyond our solar system and finding those planets that are

most likely to be habitable.

That means planets that humans could one day live on, or potentially planets that might already support alien life.

And we're going to be doing all this.

This story starts with the Kepler space telescope.

This was a state of the art telescope launched into space in 2009 for nearly 10 years.

It looked out into space and gathered data about planets beyond our solar system.

Kepler observed hundreds of thousands of stars.

And in doing so helped us discover over 4000 planets and the best part, 

Nasa shared all the data that Kepler gathered :
